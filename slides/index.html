    # Kata !

    Whatever luck I had, I made. I was never a natural athlete, but I paid my dues in sweat and concentration and took the time necessary to learn Karate and become World Champion.

    # MineSweeper

    Have you ever played Minesweeper? It’s a cute little game which comes within a certain Operating System whose name we can’t really remember. 

    Well, the goal of the game is to find all the mines within an MxN field. 

    To help you, the game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there are adjacent to that square.

    # Problem Description

    For instance, take the following 4x4 field with 2 mines (which are represented by an * character):
    
        *...
        ....
        .*..
        ....

    The same field including the hint numbers described above would look like this:

        *100
        2210
        1*10
        1110

    # Suggested Test Case 1

    test input:

        *...
        ....
        .*..
        ....

    and output :

        *100
        2210
        1*10
        1110


    ---

    # Suggested Test Case 2

    test input:

        **...
        .....
        .*...


    and output :

        **100
        33200
        1*100
